Recently I took the next big step by enrolling in the Northeastern University's Masters in Artificial Intelligence program at Boston. Apart from all that time I have been spending on artificial brains, you can find me learning about finance, going on treks or trying my hand in cooking. I love meeting new people, so please feel free to get in touch!",
